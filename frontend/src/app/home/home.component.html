        <p>Direct Market Access (DMA) is a platform that connects farmers directly with customers, 
           eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair prices for both parties. Farmers can showcase their produce, 
           and customers can buy fresh products directly from them. This helps improve farmer income and provides 
           quality food to consumers.</p>
